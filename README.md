# ChaCha Photobooth
A cute, online photo booth website built with vanilla JS, HTML5 and CSS, inspired by photo strips hanging on my dorm room. Features webcam capture, high-resolution strip downloads, and 2 custom frames I designed myself using ProCreate, and an adorable toggleable Pink/Blue theme system to match your aesthetics!

* Features:
  - Live Webcam: Connects directly to your device's camera with HD resolution support. Each photo strip has 3 photo sections.
  - Theme Selector: There are 2 theme with 2 separate frame overlays (pink and blue) that you can choose from using toggles in the top left corner.
  - High resolution download: It generates a 1200px x 3150px PNF file, easy for downloading and printing.
  - Auto-dating: A small date footer that matches the current time to keep track of your moments!
 
* Usage:
  - Clone/ Download this Repository.
  - Or using this link here to try it online: https://tra6225.github.io/chacha-customized-photobooth/
  - Choose your favourite theme and smile!
  - After finishing all three slots you can download it and take a new session.
